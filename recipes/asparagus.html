    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Having tried these two foods individually, I have no doubt that they would go great together! The healthy addition to breakfast is a nice plus.</p>
        <p>This is one where most of the ingredients are optional, to be honest. They simply bring out the flavor palette well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic, cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, ~30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning often to ensure even cooking, ~4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread asparagus out and crack eggs over it. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, ~4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, black pepper and red pepper.</li>
        </ol>

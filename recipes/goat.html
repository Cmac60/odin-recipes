    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I've never tried this recipe, but it looks simple, easy and delicious!</p>
        <p>The only difficult ingredient is the cheese itself, simply due to cost.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8oz) goat cheese log</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Press goat cheese to fit shape of a small baking dish, leaving 1-inch border around the edge. Spoon marinara around border, covering the edge of the cheese but not the middle. Salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Bake until cheese is hot and soft and marinara hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, sprinkle with fresh chopped basil.</li>
        </ol>
